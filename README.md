**Accident Alert and Location Tracking System using TTGO TCALL and GPS - "AALTS"**

The systems will detect the occurrence of an accident, notify emergency services with the exact location of this collision and also inform a select number of emergency contacts that have been set by the user.
The Accident Alert and Location Tracking System is a valuable tool for
improving road safety. By quickly detecting accidents and providing accurate location information to emergency services, the system can help to save
lives and reduces injuries. The systemâ€™s combination of advanced sensors, micro-controller technology, GPS, and GSM makes it a versatile and reliable
solution for enhancing road safety.

Integration with advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS): ADAS features such as lane departure warning, forward collision warning, and automatic emergency braking can provide additional data sources for accident
detection and alerting. Integrating these systems with accident alert and location tracking systems could improve the accuracy and timeliness of accident detection.
